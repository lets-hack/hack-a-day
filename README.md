hack-a-day
==========

for our hack-a-day stuff!

Use the [issues feature](https://github.com/lets-hack/hack-a-day/issues) on this repo to create and talk about new problems!

NOTE: Commiting your apps to this repo is totally optional as most of it can be done with gists within the issues tracker context.

## Why?

+ bone up on fun programming tasks that have nothing to do with work
+ encourage use and muscle memory for git and git hub
+ have code you've written be stored and retrievable in "the cloud" in case you need it later for bragging or as a reminder about how ~~stupid you were when you started~~ much smarter you are now
